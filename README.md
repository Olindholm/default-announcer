# Default Announcer
Replaces all announcers with the default one.

## Introduction
Announcers are cool, but as of late, the announcers quailty has become questionable. Especially the thai announcers have become an issue. They're not in english, they're strident. Frankly just annoying.

Thus, this honmod came to be, to remove all announcers with the default one.
